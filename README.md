# CODE-AI
```diff
    Come,join us. We together change the way of automation.
 ```
- #### Why CODE-AI?
 ```
 
     * In recent times we are spending a lot of time to create the best automation suites manullay to deliver the quality product to the customers. ```CODE-AI``` helps us to create the automation suites automatically.
     
 ```
- #### How it works?
```

    CODE- AI will be built to write the automation code based up on the user inputs.
     * User need to pass the parameters like directory name and file name, CODE- AI will creates the files specified.
     * User need to pass the language parameter ex:- java or python, depends up on the input main.java or main.py files will be      created by CODE-AI.
     * User need to pass the browser parameter ex: - chrome or firefox and drivers locations, so code which helps us to launch the browsers will be get created by CODE-AI.
     * User need to pass the URL, For which he need to write the automation code.
     * Then user needs to perform the functional operations on the product, depends up on the user interaction with the product,
      CODE-AI will write the code automatically to the Main.java or Main.py files.

       Selenium along with the drivers should be installed.
     ```
- #### IMPORTANT
     ```
        CODE -AI only creates the required code, In order to run the test cases created, user need to import the required modules.
     ```
- ##### Where we are now?
      ```
         * At first, we supports only for java. Later we take it to Python and then remaining languages.
         * We are going to support only for chrome and firefox now. Later we extend it to other browsers as well.
